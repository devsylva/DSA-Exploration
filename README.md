# DSA-Exploration
Hey folks!, here's a repository where I documented my data structures and algorithms learning process.

Data structures and algorithms play an important role in designing efficient and effective software needed to perform tasks or solve problems. Data structures are used to organize or store data while algorithms are step by step procedures which helps to solve problems or perform tasks.

# Data structures

### Array
Arrays are collection of elements each identified by an index or a key

### Linked List
Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a reference to the next code.

### Stacks
Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Output (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of stack.

### Queues
Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical structures with a root node and child nodes.

### Graphs
Graph consist of nodes and edges connecting these nodes.

### Hash Tables
They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array
