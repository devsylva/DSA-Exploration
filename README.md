# DSA-Exploration
Hey folks!, here's a repository where I documented my data structures and algorithms learning process.

Data structures and algorithms play an important role in designing efficient and effective software needed to perform tasks or solve problems. Data structures are used to organize or store data while algorithms are step by step procedures which helps to solve problems or perform tasks.

# Data structures

### Array
Arrays are collection of elements each identified by an index or a key

### Linked List
Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a reference to the next code.

### Stacks
Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Output (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of stack.

### Queues
Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical structures with a root node and child nodes.

### Graphs
Graph consist of nodes and edges connecting these nodes.

### Hash Tables
They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array

# Key characteristics of algorithms
Key characteristics and aspects of algorithms include:

### - Correctness
Algorithms must produce the correct output for any valid input and should solve the problem as intended. The correctness of an algorithm can often be proven using mathematical techniques.

### - Efficiency
Efficiency refers to the optimal use of computational resources such as time and memory. An efficient algorithm completes the task in a reasonable amount of time and with minimal use of resources.

### - Input and Output
Algorithms take input, process it through a series of steps, and produce an output. The input can be provided externally or generated within the algorithm, and the output can be the solution to the problem or a result of the task.

### - Finiteness
Algorithms must have a well-defined stopping point. They should terminate after a finite number of steps and not enter an infinite loop.

### - Determinism
An algorithm's behavior should be deterministic, meaning that for a given input, it should produce the same output every time it's executed.

### - Generalization
Algorithms should be designed to solve a general class of problems rather than just specific instances. This allows for the reuse of algorithms for similar problems.
