# DSA-Exploration
Hey folks!, here's a repository where I documented my data structures and algorithms learning process.

Data structures and algorithms play an important role in designing efficient and effective software needed to perform tasks or solve problems. Data structures are used to organize or store data while algorithms are step by step procedures which helps to solve problems or perform tasks.

# Data structures

### Array
Arrays are collection of elements each identified by an index or a key

### Linked List
Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a reference to the next code.
